# LCA_Freshwater_biodiversity_MSc_thesis

This repository contains all the code written for the MSc thesis in Industrial Ecology, "Freshwater Biodiversity and Life Cycle Analysis: Developing Characterization Factors for the Effect of ClimateChange on Riverine Fish Species".

A description of the files:
1) SAR.R. This file contains all the code related to the development of the Species-Area Relationship (SAR), e.g. for the results in section 3.1. 
2) GlobalCF.R. This file contains all the code related to the global effect- and characterization factors, e.g. for the results in section 3.2 and 3.4.
3) Average_area_basin.R. This file handles the geographical range contractions on the basin level scale. The BasinEF.R file further elaborates upon the output table.
4) BasinEF.R. This file contains all the code from basin level range contractions to basin level effect factors, e.g. for the results in section 3.3.
